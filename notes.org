* Notes
<2022-10-19 Wed 21:21>: In order to create a 'route' in a Rails application, you can use either 'custom routes', or use 'resource' which generates 7 routes that follow 'REST' convention.

Custom Routes:
- In order to create a 'custom route', you need:
- HTTP verb to define what action is occurring
- URL of the route itself
- 'controller#action' method that handles the request

With this in mind, I navigated to the 'config/routes.rb' file to find the 'routes' based file that Rails uses to define various routes that a user can access in a Ruby On Rails project:
#+begin_src ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  resources :shops
  # Define your application routes per the DSL in https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
  get "pets", to: "pets#index"

  # Defines the root path route ("/")
  # root "articles#index"
end
#+end_src

I then inspected the 'routes' with the 'rails routes' command accordingly:
#+begin_src bash

#+end_src

I then piped the 'rails routes' command through 'grep' with a glob pattern of 'pets':
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-4/phase-4-lecture-videos-rails-routes/pet-shop $ rails routes | grep pets
                                    pets GET    /pets(.:format)                                                                                   pets#index
#+end_src

I noticed a GIANT flaw in this video in that she did NOT mention that she created a 'pets_controller' via the 'rails generate controller pets index' command.

I had to do some research and found this random example URL:
- https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/generate-a-controller-and-view-in-ruby-on-rails/

With this in mind, I used the 'rails generate controller pets index' command accordingly:
#+begin_src ruby
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-4/phase-4-lecture-videos-rails-routes/pet-shop $ rails generate controller pets index
      create  app/controllers/pets_controller.rb
       route  get 'pets/index'
      invoke  erb
      create    app/views/pets
      create    app/views/pets/index.html.erb
      invoke  test_unit
      create    test/controllers/pets_controller_test.rb
      invoke  helper
      create    app/helpers/pets_helper.rb
      invoke    test_unit
#+end_src

I then ran the 'rails s' command which is the alias for the 'rails server' command to see how these routes actually work:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-4/phase-4-lecture-videos-rails-routes/pet-shop $ rails s
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 7.0.4 application starting in development
=> Run `bin/rails server --help` for more startup options
Puma starting in single mode...
* Puma version: 5.6.5 (ruby 2.7.0-p0) ("Birdie's Version")
*  Min threads: 5
*  Max threads: 5
*  Environment: development
*          PID: 68194
* Listening on http://127.0.0.1:3000
* Listening on http://[::1]:3000
Use Ctrl-C to stop
#+end_src

I then navigated to the 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/' web address in a web browser.

I then navigated to the 'http://127.0.0.1:3000/' web address in a web browser to access the '/pets' route accordingly since we wrote a 'get' route in the related controller accordingly via the 'rails generate controller' command mentioned above which returned the following response:
#+begin_src text
Pets#index
Find me in app/views/pets/index.html.erb
#+end_src

I then proceeded to create another route using the 'resource' keyword within the 'config/routes.rb' routes file with the following contents:
#+begin_src ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # Using basic 'http' verb + URL + method pattern:
  get 'pets/index'
  resources :shops
  # Define your application routes per the DSL in https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
  get "pets", to: "pets#index"
  # Using 'resource' keyword with just 1 of 7 various REST method options
  resource :pets, only: [:show, :create, :new, :edit, :update]

  # Defines the root path route ("/")
  # root "articles#index"
end
#+end_src

I then checked my latest revisions by using 'rails routes' again which shows that Rails used the proper HTTP verb along with the proper 'RESTful' route for the resource:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-4/phase-4-lecture-videos-rails-routes/pet-shop $ rails routes | grep pets
                              pets_index GET    /pets/index(.:format)                                                                             pets#index
                                    pets GET    /pets(.:format)                                                                                   pets#index
                                new_pets GET    /pets/new(.:format)                                                                               pets#new
                               edit_pets GET    /pets/edit(.:format)                                                                              pets#edit
                                         GET    /pets(.:format)                                                                                   pets#show
                                         PATCH  /pets(.:format)                                                                                   pets#update
                                         PUT    /pets(.:format)                                                                                   pets#update
                                         POST   /pets(.:format)                                                                                   pets#create
#+end_src
